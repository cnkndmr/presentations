		Ethotoin (C$_{11}$H$_{12}$N$_{2}$O$_{2}$, Peganone) is a member of hydantoin derivative antiepileptic drug.
		Structure of ethotoin is an imidazolidine-2,4-dione that is hydantoin substituted by ethyl and phenyl at positions 3 and 5, respectively.
		Mechanism of action of ethotoin is, influences synaptic transmission by altering sodium and calcium ion influx across neuronal membranes in the repolarization, depolarization, and membrane stability phase and interferes with the calcium uptake in presynaptic terminals.
		This inhibits neuronal discharge and occurs in the stabilization of neuronal membranes, there by preventing the spread of seizure activity at the motor cortex.
		Ethotoin is also generally used for tonic-clonic and partial complex seizures.
		The 3D structure of Ethotoin obtained from ZINC database with code 271.
