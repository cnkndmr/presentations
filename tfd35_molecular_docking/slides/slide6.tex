\frametitle{Docking Analysis}
Structure based computational modeling of ligand-receptor interactions is a prominent part of modern drug discovery. Molecular docking calculations are often preferred methods that used in the structure-based drug design (SBDD) studies to define the interaction of the molecule with the protein in which the molecule interacts within the body, respectively. Molecular docking study is also able to predict the binding conformations and free energies of ligands that is drug candidate molecules within the appropriate target binding site \cite{ferreira2015molecular}. Molecular docking calculations were realized using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 \cite{trott2010autodock} software.
