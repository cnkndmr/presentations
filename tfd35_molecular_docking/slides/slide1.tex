Drug-DNA interactions are very important in pharmaceutical chemistry because drug interactions of anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial and other drugs are directly related to their binding to DNA. In this study, molecular docking calculations were performed to investigate B-DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) binding interaction with hydantoin-based drugs such as Phenytoin, Mephenytoin, and Ethotoin. According to the results of molecular docking, the interaction area and binding distances between the three drugs and DNA helix were determined. The results show that Phenytoin and Ethotoin bound to DNA with -5.8 kcal/mol binding energies, Mephenytoin bound to DNA with -6.0 kcal/mol binding energies respectively. B-DNA dodecamer (PDB: 1BNA) with 1.9 Ã… resolution was used for docking calculations in order to investigate the drug binding area with binding energies. Molecular docking calculations were realized using AutoDock 4.2 software.
